# Code of Conduct

Caspian is built by developers, for developers. We want this to be a space where anyone can contribute, ask questions, and collaborate without hassle.

## The Short Version

Be respectful. Assume good intent. Help others learn.

## What We Expect

**Do:**
- Give constructive feedback on code, not on people
- Share knowledge when you see someone struggling
- Accept that there are many valid approaches to solving problems
- Credit others when building on their work

**Don't:**
- Make it personal — critique code, not character
- Gatekeep or dismiss newcomers
- Spam, self-promote, or derail discussions
- Share others' private information

## Reporting Issues

If something's off, email [adarsh.bhardwaj2020@gmail.com](mailto:adarsh.bhardwaj2020@gmail.com). Reports are handled privately and taken seriously.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove comments, close issues, or ban users who violate these guidelines. We'd rather not — we're all here to build good software.
